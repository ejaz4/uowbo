# uowbo!

## Do I need it?

## Development
If you want to aid development of uowbo! by contributing, follow these steps to get you started.
### Prequisites
- Git
- Node.js
- A Discord server
- (optional) mailing server

### Setting up the repository
In your terminal, clone the repository using:

```git clone https://github.com/ejaz4/uowbo```

This will pull the latest source of uowbo and two submodules, these submodules might not usually be pinned to the latest commit of their repository. As you are developing, `cd` into whichever submodule you want to work on, create a new branch using the name scheme: `type/description`.

In each submodule folder there is a `.example.env` file that must be filled and copied to `.env`. If you add a new key-value pair, you must also add it to the `.env.example` in the mono-repo as well and in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

In each of the repositories, run `yarn` to install all the dependencies.
